# ML_Ops Wine Quality Classification Project 
**Description :**
We use scikit-learn pipelines to train our random forest algorithm and build a wine quality classifier. After training, we will automate the evaluation process using CML. 
From training to evaluation, the entire process will be automated using GitHub actions
**Objectives**
Develop scikit-learn pipelines to train our random forest algorithm
Build a wine quality classifier 
Automate the evaluation process using CML
Build entire  process as workflow  on GitHub actions

****Tools ****
scikit-learn | Random forest classifier 
Github actions for workflows
CML for CI pipeline
Project environment container: Docker

**Data set **
Wine Quality data |UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
